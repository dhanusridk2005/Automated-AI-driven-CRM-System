- *Automated Email Classification:* Categorizes emails using AI.
- *Intelligent Data Extraction:* Extracts sender details, urgency, and key information.
- *CRM Integration:* Updates structured data automatically.
- *Scalability:* Handles high email volumes with cloud compatibility.
- *Security & Privacy:* Encrypted data storage and role-based access control.

## *Technology Stack*
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *AI Model:* LLaMA (Ollama)
- *Database:* SQLite (Scalable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- *Email Handling:* IMAP (imaplib, email)
- *Other Modules:* OS, Time, Secure Credential Management

## *Installation & Setup*
### *Prerequisites*
